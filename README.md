# EZ HOUSING
Welcome to the easy housing project.
Are you struggling to find a house in the Netherlands? I know your feeling...

There are many web site that may help you (pararius, funda, etc) but sometimes you would just have the list of the houses in a single file so that you can check them, and query them based on your requirements (pets allowed, balcony, income requirements and so on)

This is the idea behind this project, making a tool that can gather house data from these web site and build just a single database that can be queried and accessible easily.
Of course, the information provided comes from the original website, and during the parsing phase, there would be some errors or missing. But no worries, you also got the original link, so if you find an interesting apartment in Utrecht you always can check it on the original website.

This repo is still under development. And it is a personal project, so don't blame me if I'm updating it every day. Of course, any constructive comment is appreciated.


## Note
So far the project works only with Pararius.

I may use tools not strictly necessary for learning purposes.

## Usage
In this section, I explain how to use the code to get the information you need.
